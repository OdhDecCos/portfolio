            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm an Irish student studying at <em><a href="esme.fr">ESME Sudria</a></em>, 
                an engineering school located in France. <br>
                Hard worker, team player and problem solver are three qualities that define me. <br>
                I'm passionate about self-improvement, which manifests itself through stoicism and physical exercise. <br>
                Recently having started my last year of engineering, I am currently looking for an internship near Bordeaux, France. <br>
                Feel free to <em><a href="">contact me</a></em> for more information!

            <h2>Skills & Experience</h2>
            <p>
                5 years of engineering school have taught me many different skills. <br>
                I chose to major in Mechatronics, hoping to enjoy a carrer in robotics, 
                specifically working on motion contol in the industrial field.
